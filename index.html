    <h1> <u> About Me </u> </h1>
    <p>I am currently a full-time student pursuing an MS in Business Analytics and Information Management (BAIM) 
      from the Krannert School of Management at Purdue University. Having studied Mathematics and Business Management Systems at 
      Taylor University, I am very interested in creating statistical models from large datasets to help drive business outcomes 
      and decisions. Upon graduation from Purdue in May of 2022, I will be pursuing a job in the Supply Chain field as a Data Scientist. 
      I really enjoy going for walks with my wife, watching football on the weekends, and playing board and card games like Catan, Euchre, Hearts, and Sequence!</p>

     <h3> Project Completed by: Jackson Bronkema and Pavan Ghantasala </h3>
      <p>In our Data Visualization class, we were tasked with using monthly sales data sets and other data found online to present a marketing strategy
        that would increase the sales of both Toyota and Lexus. This project was challenging, but very exciting! Based on the data, we suggested that Toyota
        focus on selling SUV's, segement certain groups with certain cars, and increase their online  marketing precense for hybrids and electric vehicles.</p>

     <h3> Project Completed by: Jackson Bronkema, Pavan Ghantasala, Mithull Singh, and Sahil Patil  </h3>
      <p>In this open ended project, we used a data sets from Kaggle to help C-Suite at Amazon to better understand what content is best 
        in building and keeping their platform. During this anlysis, we also took a deep dive into their main competitors - Netflix, Hulu, 
        HBO Max, and Disney +. We were able to see which areas Amazon Prime was doing well, and which areas there was room for improvement.</p>

    <!-- Using PCA to Rank NBA Players -->
    <h2> <u> Using Principle Component Analysis to Rank and Scout NBA Players </u> </h2>
     <h3> Project Completed by: Jackson Bronkema</h3>
      <p>During my final semester studying mathematics at Taylor University, I was able to conduct semester long research on a topic of my choice. Being a sports fan, expecially from 
    a business analytics perspective, I choose to use a linear algebra concept called Principle Component Analysis to analyze the true worth of NBA players.
        During this project, I collected data on current players and all-time great players to rank them. I also took a financial application of these rankings and adivsed NBA teams
    on how they should use analytics to decide on which players they should sign in free agency and the NBA draft. I was also able to present my research to a live audience on math majors and professors,
    which was very rewarding! </p>
