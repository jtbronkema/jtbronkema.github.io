    <h1> <u> About Me </u> </h1>
    <p>I am currently a full-time student pursuing an MS in Business Analytics and Information Management (BAIM) 
      from the Krannert School of Management at Purdue University. Having studied Mathematics and Business Management Systems at 
      Taylor University, I am very interested in creating statistical models from large datasets to help drive business outcomes 
      and decisions. Upon graduation from Purdue in May of 2022, I will be pursuing a job in the Supply Chain field as a Data Scientist. 
      I really enjoy going for walks with my wife, watching football on the weekends, and playing board and card games like Catan, Euchre, Hearts, and Sequence!</p>

    <h2> <u> Using Data and Storytelling in Tableau to Improve Lexus and Toyota's Marketing Strategy </u> </h2>
     <h3> Project Completed by: Jackson Bronkema and Pavan Ghantasala </h3>
      <p>In our Data Visualization class, we were tasked with using monthly sales data sets and other data found online to present a marketing strategy
        that would increase the sales of both Toyota and Lexus. This project was challenging, but very exciting! Based on the data, we suggested that Toyota
        focus on selling SUV's, segement certain groups with certain cars, and increase their online  marketing precense for hybrids and electric vehicles.</p>
