<h2> <u> About Me </u> </h2>
I am currently a full-time student pursuing an MS in Business Analytics and Information Managment (BAIM) <br> 
from the Krannert School of Management at Purdue University. Having studied Mathematics and Business <br>
Manangement Systems at Taylor University, I am very interested in creating statistical models from large <br>
datasets to help drive businessoutcomes and decisions. Upon graduation from Purdue in May of 2022, I will <br>
be pursuing a job in the Supply Chain field as a Data Scientist. I really enjoy going for walks with my wife, <br>
watching football on the weeks, and playing board games!
