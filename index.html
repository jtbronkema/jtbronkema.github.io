    <h2> <u> About Me </u> </h2>
    <p>I am currently a full-time student pursuing an MS in Business Analytics and Information Management (BAIM) from the Krannert School of Management at Purdue University. Having studied Mathematics and Business Management Systems at Taylor University, I am very interested in creating statistical models from large datasets to help drive business outcomes and decisions. Upon graduation from Purdue in May of 2022, I will be pursuing a job in the Supply Chain field as a Data Scientist. I really enjoy going for walks with my wife, watching football on the weeks, and playing board games!</p>
